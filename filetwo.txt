In the “Rotational Inertia Experiment” we were asked to investigate the link between torque, angular acceleration, and linear acceleration. We used known relationships and equations along with our values found in the experiment to calculate several velocities and accelerations to help us to find the calculated moment of inertia of the system. First we found all of our values for mass/dimensions of accessories including uncertainties. Our next goal was to find the frictional resistance of the drum and pulley so that we could deduct this from our other found values of descending masses to ensure our calculations for torque were correct and repeated this for all four experiments. We did this by attaching a mass to the end of the string and determining when the drum was turning at a constant rate and recorded that mass in our table so that we could later deduct it from our descending mass. We then added additional mass to the string (per lab instructions) measured the distance y of descent including uncertainty and performed several trials for each disk, hoop, and cylinder to give us values to use in our calculations. Before we could calculate our I values we had to determine the final linear and angular velocities as well as the final linear and angular acceleration to help us in the end goal of finding the I of the system.  Since we had the values for distance (y), initial velocity and the time we could use kinematic equations to solve for linear/angular velocities and accelerations. There were many things we had to take into account when performing this experiment. One of the major issues we encountered was in weighing the disk, hoop and cylinders using the balance scales. The weight of each object
